# TNW-clone

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
<p>In this project, I cloned The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced. I used breakpoints, media queries and positioning/floating attributes that are needed to make them rearrange as necessary when the browser changes sizes. Then I changed the style of picture according to its breakpoints.</p>
